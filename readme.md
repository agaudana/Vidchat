                                                          1. Schedule meeting section
                                                           
                                                          ISSUES TO BE FIXED :
                                                          1. Change color of chat button, as it is hard to see.
                                                          2. Style the schedule meeting section, as it is pretty ugly.
                                                          
                                                          FEATURES TBA! 
                                                          2. Ability to switch between local video and remote video to be bigger
